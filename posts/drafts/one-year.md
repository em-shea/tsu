It's the one year anniversary of starting this blog! This post will be a look back on the past year and some of my thoughts on starting a technical blog.

So far, I've published **11 posts and seen 3,785 unique readers and an average of 72 users per week**. This has beyond exceeded my initial expectations! My goal in blogging has been to share what I'm learning, and in the process better understand the concepts and get more comfortable writing technically. It's exciting to see people are learning from what I've written.

Here are a few things I've observed while writing this past year.

Keeping **a rough posting schedule helps me get new posts out regularly.** I try to publish a new blog post about once a month. This cadence works for me in that even if I have a few busy weeks, I can still find a couple days within the month to write a post. I typically have 4-5 post ideas or outlines waiting to be fleshed out into full posts.

Many of my **post ideas come from questions that I get asked often**, i.e. How did you get started building serverless apps? How did you prepare for the Associate Certified Solutions Architect exam? Having this written up into a post is helpful to be able to share more easily. It's also been fun to meet people that are new to AWS serverless that happen to find my posts.
